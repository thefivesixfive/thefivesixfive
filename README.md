## Greetings, fivesixfive here 👋

I'm Caleb "fivesixfive" North, preferrably known as a programmer who makes\
videos about programming. I provide clean, entertaining, and sometimes stupid\
content. I publish my videos on YouTube and occasionally livestream on Twitch.

I've worked heavily with Python for an upwards of six years to make various\
softwares and Discord bots. I even made a game on the side, which is my\
personal favorite project.

I'm also a Christian, but not the Bible-thumping kind.
