Greetings, fivesixfive here. I'm somewhere between "developer" and "gamer", and my content is too. I'm currently making a game called Rebound while recording the development on YouTube and my various social medias. I also enjoy playing, uploading, and livestreaming Krunker.

My socials, contact info, and extended bio can be found on my website:
