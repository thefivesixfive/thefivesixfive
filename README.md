Greetings, fivesixfive here. I type, I click, and magic happens. Right now I'm making a game called Rebound, and I'm also working on music whenever I can. Sometimes I livestream or upload a video or two as well.

My real name is Caleb North, and I've been working with code for an upwards of 8 years. I've always loved being truly able to make whatever I could possibly want. While my repertoire includes a web scraper, a handful of Discord bots, and this website, I enjoy game development the most because of how it combines coding, music, art, and game design all into one project.
