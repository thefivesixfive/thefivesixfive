<h2>Heyo, I'm Caleb North</h2>
I’m a programmer and game developer who occasionally dabbles in music production. My passion for coding began when I was eight years old and eager to make games, and since then I have learned quite a lot. Nowadays, if I’m not working on school or hanging out with friends, my time is spent in game engines and IDEs. I also upload to YouTube now and then to update the world on my work.
