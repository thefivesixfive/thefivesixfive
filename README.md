I'm Caleb "fivesixfive" North, preferrably known as a programmer who makes
videos about programming. I try to provide entertaining content that's
appropriate.  I enjoy playing games, drawing, and dabbling in a variety
of other things, often poorly.

I'm also a Christian, and while it affects every part of my life,
it's not my entire personality. I'm not thumping my Bible in every
video (because that would be annoying as frick).
