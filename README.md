## Greetings, fivesixfive here 👋

I'm Caleb "fivesixfive" North, preferrably known as a programmer who makes
videos about programming. I try to provide entertaining content that's
appropriate.  I enjoy playing games, livestreaming, drawing, and dabbling in a variety
of other things, often poorly. 

Quick backstory: I've been programming since I was 9 on Scratch 2.
I work heavily with Python now but have dabbled in C# in Unity when
I made a game (https://fivesixfive.itch.io/dnm). Currently I code
whatever, often Discord bots, for fun.

I'm also devout Christian. But if my beliefs conflict with yours, that's ok with me.\
Everyone is human being and deserves to be treated like one.
