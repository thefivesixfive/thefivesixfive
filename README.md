### Greetings, fivesixfive here ðŸ‘‹

Well, I'm not great at summarizing things, so here goes.\
If it wasn't apparent by now, I'm a programmer. I do my own\
stuff and publish videos about it on YouTube, and sometimes\
I play games live on Twitch.

I'm also a Christian, and all the content I make is\
guaranteed clean. I'm not one of _those_ Christians though.

My socials and contact info can be found
on my website:\
