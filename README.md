## Greetings, fivesixfive here 👋
I'm Caleb "fivesixfive" North, better known as a programmer who makes videos about programming.

My mission is to provide clean and entertaining content to make the world a better place. I myself am a programmer, a student, and a Christian. (Not the Bible thumping kind). Enjoy my content!
